**Real-Time Emotion Detection using DeepFace**

A simple Python script that uses OpenCV and the DeepFace library to detect emotions in real-time.

### Installation

1. Install OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
2. Install DeepFace: `pip install deepface`

### Usage

1. Run the script: `python emotion_detection.py`
2. Use your webcam: The script will display a window showing the real-time video feed with detected emotions.
3. Press 'q' to exit: When you're done, press the 'q' key to stop the script and close all windows.

### Features

* Real-time emotion detection using DeepFace
* Detects emotions from faces in the video feed
* Displays the dominant emotion on each frame
* Supports multiple camera inputs (not implemented in this example)

### Credits

This script is based on the original DeepFace documentation and examples. The code has been modified to work with
